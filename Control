In C, control structures are constructs that allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions or criteria. There are three main types of control structures in C:

    Conditional statements:
        if statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
        else statement: Executes a block of code if the if condition is false.
        else if statement: Executes a block of code if a second specified condition is true.
        switch statement: Executes a block of code based on a variable's value.

    Loops:
        for loop: Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.
        while loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
        do-while loop: Repeats a block of code at least once and then continues repeating as long as a specified condition is true.

    Jump statements:
        break statement: Terminates the current loop or switch statement and transfers control to the statement immediately following it.
        continue statement: Skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration.
        goto statement: Transfers control to a labeled statement in your program.

Here's an example that uses conditional statements and a loop:

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    if (num > 0) {
        printf("%d is a positive number\n", num);
    } else if (num < 0) {
        printf("%d is a negative number\n", num);
    } else {
        printf("%d is neither positive nor negative\n", num);
    }

    int i;
    for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i == 5) {
            continue;
        }
        printf("%d ", i);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}

In this example, we use an if-else statement to determine whether a number is positive, negative, or neither. We then use a for loop to print the numbers 1 through 10, except for the number 5, which we skip using the continue statement.
