In C programming, the basic arithmetic operations are performed using the following operators:

    Addition (+): Adds two values and returns the sum.

Example:

c

int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int c = a + b; // c will be 30

    Subtraction (-): Subtracts one value from another and returns the difference.

Example:

c

int a = 20;
int b = 10;
int c = a - b; // c will be 10

    Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values and returns the product.

Example:

c

int a = 5;
int b = 4;
int c = a * b; // c will be 20

    Division (/): Divides one value by another and returns the quotient.

Example:

c

int a = 20;
int b = 5;
int c = a / b; // c will be 4

    Modulus (%): Divides one value by another and returns the remainder.

Example:

c

int a = 20;
int b = 3;
int c = a % b; // c will be 2

These arithmetic operators can be used with both integer and floating-point values.
